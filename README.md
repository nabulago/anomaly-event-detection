## Detecting anomalous events in videos by learning deep representations of appearance and motion

An implementation of paper **Detecting anomalous events in videos by learning deep representations of appearance and motion** on python, opencv and tensorflow. This paper uses the _stacked denoising autoencoder_ for the the _feature_ training on the _appearance_ and _motion flow_ features as input for different window sizes and using _multiple SVM_ as a weighted single classifier this is work under progress if anyone can contribute I would be glad to work.

### File details
Most of the files contains the script and details in the files. Once scrpit splices the imges of different size for apperance model: windows size - _15x15_, _18x18_, 20x20
